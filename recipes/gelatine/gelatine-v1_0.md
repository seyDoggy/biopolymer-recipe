# Gelatine with glycernin and corn syrup

## Ingredients
1. 1 cup cold water
1. 1 cup vegetable glycerin
1. 1/2 cup gelatine
1. 6 1/2 tbsp white corn syrup
1. 3 tbsp sugar
1. 1/4 tsp salt
1. 2 g sucralose (two packets Splenda)
1. Food coloring as desired
1. Flavoring as desired

## Directions
1. Combine water and glycerin in a mixing bowl.
1. Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, stirring gently once a light film appears. Repeat this until most of the gelatine has been added and the mixture becomes a thick dough. You should be left with about 1 to 2 tbsp of gelatine.
1. Combine corn syrup, sugar, salt and sucralose.
1. Microwave the syrup mixture at 10 second intervals until the temperature reaches 190Â°F.
1. Add the hot syrup to the gelatine dough and mix until gelatin begins to melt.
1. Continue to add the remaining gelatin, slowly mixing in to ensure no clumps.
1. Microwave the mixture at 10 second intervals, stirring frequently, until the mixture is smooth and adequately runny. DO NOT BOIL the gelatin.
1. Add trace amounts of food coloring as required for desired coloration.

## Tips
1. If you have access to a vacuum chamber, degassing the mixture will significantly help elasticity.
1. Adding a few table spoons of alcohol prior to degassing can help the degassing process.

## Injection baits
1. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expel to "burp" the injector.
1. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
1. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
1. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
1. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
1. To remelt cured polymer, microwave for 10 second intervals, stirring frequently.
1. Add very small amounts of water as needed to achieve the desired consistency.
1. Inject as above.

## Storing
1. Store polymer and baits in airtight bags at room temperature or in the refrigerator until ready to use.
1. Vegetable oil can be used to prolong shelf life.

## Scents and attractants
Experiment with adding trace amounts of water soluble compounds such as brewed coffee, water from a tuna can, etc, during the mixing process. Alternatively, try storing the baits in an oil based solution with garlic or other such flavorings.
