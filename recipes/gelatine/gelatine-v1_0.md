# Gelatine with glycernin and corn syrop
## Ingredients
1. 1 cup cold water
1. 1 cup vegatable glycerin
1. 1/2 cup gelatine
1. 6 1/5 tbsp white corn syrup
1. 3 tbsp sugar
1. 1/4 tsp salt
1. 2 g sucralose (two packets Splenda)

## Directions
1. Combine water and glycerin in a mixing bowl.
1. Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, stirring gently once a light film appears. Repeat this until most of the gelatine has been added and the mixture becomes a thick dough. You should be left with about 1 to 2 tbsp of gelatine.
1. Combine corn syrup, sugar, salt and sucralose.
1. Microwave the syrup mixture at 10 second intervals until the temperature reaches 190°F.
1. Add the hot syrup to the gelatine dough and mix until gelatin begins to melt.
1. Microwave the mixture at 10 second intervals, stirring frequently, until the mixuture is smooth and adequatly runny. DO NOT BOIL the gelatin.
1. Add trace amounts of food coloring as required for desired coloration.

## Injection baits
1. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expell to "burp" the injector.
1. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
1. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
1. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
1. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
1. To remelt cured polymer, microwave for 10 second intervals, stirring frequently.
1. Add very small amounts of water as needed to acheive the desired consistancy.
1. Inject as above.

## Storing
1. Store polymer and baits in airtight bags at room temperature or in the refrigerator until ready to use.
1. Vegatable oil can be used to prolong shelf life.

## Scents and attractants
Experiment with adding trace amounts of water soluable compounds such as brewed coffee, water from a tuna can, etc during the mixing process. Alternatively, try storing the baits in an oil based soution with garlic or other such flavorings.
