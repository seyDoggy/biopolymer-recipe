# Gelatine with glycernin and corn syrup (refined cooking method)
## Experiment Results

The modified preparation process made for baits that were clear and free of air bubbles, but the elastic modulus of the final product was too low to make these baits viable. I suspect that the sugar wasn't cooked at a high enough temperature to cause sufficient inversion. Additional experimentation along this line are warranted.


## Ingredients
1. 1 cup cold water
1. 1 cup vegetable glycerin
1. 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp gelatine (depending on bloom)
1. 6 1/2 tbsp white corn syrup
1. 3 tbsp sugar
1. 1/4 tsp salt
1. 2 g sucralose (two packets Splenda)
1. Food coloring as desired
1. Flavoring as desired

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
1. Combine water, glycerin and corn syrup in a mixing bowl.
1. Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, stirring gently once a light film appears. Repeat this until most of the gelatine has been added and the mixture becomes a thick dough or the consistency of mashed potatoes. You could be left with about 1 to 2 tbsp of gelatine, depending on the bloom (strength) of your gelatine.
1. Combine corn syrup, sugar, salt and sucralose.
1. In a Pyrex dish, place the sugar mixture in the oven and heat until it reaches a temperature of 235°F. Stir gently only occasionally.
1. Let sugar mixture cool to no more than 190°F then combine sugar and gelatin mixture and gently fold together until gelatin is fully melted.
1. Add entire mixture to the oven until it reaches 190°F.
1. Add coloring and flavoring to suit.
1. Remove the mixture from the oven and let cure in the refrigerator for 24-72 hours.
1. After fully cured, remove from fridge and cut off any hardened froth or foam.
1. Reheat mixture slowly in the oven at a temperature of 190°F or just warm enough to keep mixture the desired consistency while pouring lures.

## Injection baits
1. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expel to "burp" the injector.
1. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
1. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
1. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
1. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
1. To remelt cured polymer, warm in oven at 190°F until mixture is melted and workable.
1. Add very small amounts of water as needed to achieve the desired consistency.
1. Inject as above.

## Storing
1. Store polymer and baits in airtight bags at room temperature or in the refrigerator until ready to use.
1. Vegetable oil can be used to prolong shelf life.

## Scents and attractants
Experiment with adding trace amounts of water soluble compounds such as brewed coffee, water from a tuna can, etc, during the mixing process. Alternatively, try storing the baits in an oil based solution with garlic or other such flavorings.
