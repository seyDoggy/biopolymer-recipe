# Crosslinked Gelatine using water, sugar and sodium carbonate (washing soda)
## Working notes
- gelatine 17% weight (21.0 g)
- corn syrop 10% weight (14 g)
- sodium carbonate 2% weight (2.4 g)
- glycerin N% weight at heating step (50 g)
- water N% weight at heating step (50 g)

- combine all liquids and sodium carbonate
- sprinke gelatin over top and allow to fully bloom
- dissolve all ingredients on low heat
- final dissolved weight was 102.8 g
- placed in oven at 190°F
- cook time - 30 minutes

## Experiment results
- resulting compound attained crosslinking prior to cooking in the oven, rendering it unusable

## Ingredients
1. 50g cold water
1. 50g glycerin
1. 21g gelatin
1. 14g white corn syrup
1. 2.4g sodium carbonate
1. Food coloring as desired
1. Flavoring as desired

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 190°F.
1. Combine water, corn syrup and sodium carbonate in a small pot.
1. Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, stirring gently once a light film appears. Repeat this until most of the gelatine has been added.
1. Slowly dissolve the mixture over low heat on the stove top.
1. In a Pyrex dish, place the mixture in the oven and let bake for 2 hours to allow the crosslinking process to take place.
1. Remove the mixture from the oven and pour or inject the mixture into moulds as appropriate.

## Injection baits
1. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expel to "burp" the injector.
1. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
1. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
1. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
1. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
Crosslinking is not typically reversible, making this composition suitable for immediate manufacture only.

## Storing
1. Unknown

## Scents and attractants
Experiment with adding trace amounts of water soluble compounds such as brewed coffee, water from a tuna can, etc, during the mixing process. Alternatively, try storing the baits in an oil based solution with garlic or other such flavorings.
