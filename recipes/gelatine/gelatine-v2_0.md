# Crosslinked Gelatine using water, sugar and sodium carbonate (washing soda)
## Working notes
- water N% weight at heating step (75 g)
- gelatine 17% weight (21.0 g)
- glycerin N% weight at heating step (25 g)
- corn syrop 10% weight (14 g)
- sodium carbonate 2% weight (2.4 g)

- sprinkle gelatin over top and allow to fully bloom
- dissolve gelatin mixture on low heat
- combine corn syrup and glycerin in a separate bowl and add to dissolved gelatine
- add sodium carbonate
- final dissolved weight was 102.8 g
- placed in oven at 190°F
- cook time - 2 hours

## Experiment results
- due to a calculation error, I've doubled everything but the water
- crosslinking occured at 50 minutes and compound was unusable

## Ingredients
1. 75g cold water
1. 25g glycerin
1. 21g gelatin
1. 14g white corn syrup
1. 2.4g sodium carbonate
1. Food coloring as desired
1. Flavoring as desired

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 190°F.
1. Combine water, corn syrup and sodium carbonate in a small pot.
1. Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, stirring gently once a light film appears. Repeat this until most of the gelatine has been added.
1. Slowly dissolve the mixture over low heat on the stove top.
1. In a Pyrex dish, place the mixture in the oven and let bake for 2 hours to allow the crosslinking process to take place.
1. Remove the mixture from the oven and pour or inject the mixture into moulds as appropriate.

## Injection baits
1. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expel to "burp" the injector.
1. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
1. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
1. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
1. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
Crosslinking is not typically reversible, making this composition suitable for immediate manufacture only.

## Storing
1. Unknown

## Scents and attractants
Experiment with adding trace amounts of water soluble compounds such as brewed coffee, water from a tuna can, etc, during the mixing process. Alternatively, try storing the baits in an oil based solution with garlic or other such flavorings.
