# Gelatine with glycernin and corn syrup (refined cooking method)
## Experiment Results
This was a successful experiment by the measure that there is a functional product as the outcome. The end product I was able 
to replicate 4 times with acceptable consistency.  I used various scents which
I note below.  I don't know how to measure elastic modulus, but if I stretch a 1" (dia) x 3" (long) 
cylinder 4 times it's length.  It returns to it's original shape in less than a second.  Images are included in the images folder.
The mixture was relatively translucent given 10 drops of food coloring gel.  The color is similar to a roboworm.  There is some significant transparency.  
Without worm oil it still managed to be somewhat glossy in the thinner areas.  There is an image of black w/ black flake Bandito Bug which is the control
provided by the mold manufacturer.  It is made in plastisol.  Outside of some tearing, I did not notice a signficant difference between the two


### Special Equipment (different from the previous experiments)
* I did not use an oven
* I used a pot with a temperature controlled induction cooktop for the inversion of the sugar
  * I used an Amazon Basics Induction Cooktop.  It has temperature controls but only in large increments there are two relavent settings
    200F and 240F
* I used a Water Circulator in a bath
* I used glass mason jars

## Recipe adjustments
* I removed the corn syrup in step 2, and simply put it all in at step 5. Initially I did this because it was unclear
how much I should put in each step.  In the end I think the result is fine with corn syrup only in step 5.

* I updated ingredients with gram measure as I believe it gives a more consistent result and allows a more accurate adjustment of 
ingredients when needed.  The finished product batch weighs about 845g + color, attractant and flake.  To give you an idea of the yield, I used about 
6g(50ml) of liquid to fill the mold(Googan Bandito Bug).  So cutting the final product into cubes for single servings makes an efficient
use without spoiling the remainder of the batch.

## Ingredients
1. 1 cup (230g) cold water
2. 1 cup (335g) vegetable glycerin
3. 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp (100g) gelatine (300 Bloom)
4. 6 1/2 (130g) tbsp white corn syrup
5. 3 tbsp (45g) sugar
6. 1/4 tsp (3g) salt
7. 2 g sucralose (two packets Splenda)
8. Food coloring as desired
9. Flavoring as desired

## Directions
1. Combine water and glycerine into a bowl. (it is not a lot of liquid, but the wider the bowl, the more gelatine you can put over
 the surface and the faster this step becomes) Slowly sprinkle gelatine very lightly over the surface, a light film will appear.  I
do not stir. I just continue to sprinkle as the first layer moistens.
2. Once you've added all the gelatine then stir to make sure the gelatine is fully incorporated
3. In an induction reactive pot, combine corn syrup, sugar, salt and sucralose
4. Set the induction to 240F and stir occasionally to ensure sugar, salt and sucralose are well incorporated into the syrup
5. At around the 220F mark it will start to bubble.  This is fine, continue to let it climb to 235F, no higher than 244F
6. Add Gelatine mixture to the sugar mixture.  Stir frequently until well incorporated
7. Again heat the mixture to 235F.  You will see bubbles again
8. Once at temperature.  Remove from heat.  Place into container or put entire pot into refridgerator.  Cure 24 - 72 hours.
   Elasticity is increased the longer it cures as well as "shelf life".

## Storing
1. At this point you can store the polymer for further use.  You don't need to use all of it at once
2. I cut the block into cubes about 50g each and vacuum sealed in bags.  This allows you to take what you need.  I'm unsure
of the effects of the constant heating/reheating cycles.
3. Store polymer and baits in airtight bags at room temperature or in the refrigerator until ready to use.
4. Vegetable oil can be used to prolong shelf life

## Injection baits
1. Preheat immersion bath to 195F
2. Place mold in freezer or refrigerator
3. Place cubes of polymer into a mason jar or similar container (plastic works as well).  Then place container in bath.
   A cover helps ensure water and condensate don't mix with the polymer
4. Once polymer is a complete liquid again, you can add flake, scent, attractant and flavor.  For the images included, no more than
   ten drops of color were included. Same for scent and attractant
5. With a hand injector, draw up a couple table spoons of warm mixture, and expel to "burp" the injector.
6. Draw enough mixture to inject into the molds at hand.
7. Inject into room temperature or cold molds.
8. Let stand for 5 minutes, or add molds to the freezer.
9. Open molds and remove baits and let air cure for a couple minutes before bagging.

## Remelting
1. To remelt cured polymer, warm in oven at 190Â°F or repeat water circulator method above until mixture is melted and workable.
2. Inject as above.

## Scents and attractants
In this experiment I tried with the following:
* coffee
* fish sauce
* soy sauce
* garlic confit (infused olive oil w/ garlic)
* rendered pork fat
* shrimp paste

  All of these "worked" except for shrimp paste.  The water based scents worked well.  Fish sauce is awful and I'm sure it will catch tons
  of fish.  Less successful was rendered pork fat.  It was not noticable.  The problem with the shrimp paste was the solids.
