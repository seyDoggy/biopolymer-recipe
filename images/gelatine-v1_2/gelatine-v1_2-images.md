## uncured post mold baits
These baits are originally scraps from a bad molding.  I did not put these in the fridge for any amount of time after the molding/injecting process.  They were a little bit softer, and noticiably different than cured baits.  I wanted to see if they broke down easier.  Uncured biopolymer could be better for baits that need softer material like a paddle tail or minnow immitation

## cured post mold baits
These baits were put back into the fridge for at least 24 hours.  In the case of the green, the bait was demolded and then put in the fridge.  The blue bait was put in the fridge while still in the mold.  The blue bait came out significantly easier and cleaner with less breaks than the green.  They are curly and bent because they were stored in a simple bag rather than a clam shell or even laid flat.  After a few minutes in the room temperature air they can be straightened out again.  Probably something to note about the material's performance in the summer vs winter
